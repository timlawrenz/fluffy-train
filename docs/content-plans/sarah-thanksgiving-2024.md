## Sarah's Voice Guidelines

**DO:**
- Understated, personal, specific
- Focus on moments/feelings
- 0-1 emoji max
- Short to medium length

**DON'T:**
- Generic gratitude lists
- Performative language
- Over-capitalized excitement
- Food/turkey/traditional themes

## Backup Plan

**If anything breaks:**
- Manual posting works fine
- Stories can fill gaps
- Quality > Quantity
- Skip rather than force misaligned content

**Guiding Principle**: "No matter what, we post a few times a week"
