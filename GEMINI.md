This project aims to automate the selection and posting of images to Instagram.
The core idea is to use the rich, semantic information captured in image embeddings, specifically CLIP and DINO embeddings, to intelligently select images for posting, and then use the Facebook API to handle the scheduling and posting to Instagram.
